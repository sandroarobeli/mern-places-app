THIS VERSION IS FOR LEARNING ONLY

The goal is to develop a stable "road map" of building MERN stack
applications that will become a standard to build on for me in the future  

The app featured in these files is a full stack MERN based 
program. the current first version pursues the purpose of 
learning and dissecting individual component-building blocks,
as well as the ways of connecting those blocks and modules and 
general good practices of doing so.

The plan for upcoming second version will be to utilize material-ui
based styling and functionality instead of pure css featured here
There is a lot of exciting work to be done
